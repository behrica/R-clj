# r-clj

A Clojure library designed to define an abstract protocol to use R functionality from Clojure.

This protocol should be of highl level, so it is not planned to be a replacement of other approaches such as JRI and javaR.
It should be possible that the protocol gets implemented by existing lower level API's such as JRI,rincanter, jvmr and opencpu.

This gives other projects, such as Incanter. a common way to access R functionality inependent from teh lower layer technology used.
